## Backend

The project's backend is built with Django and deployed through Heroku app. It can be accessed via:

https://quizzerapp-2c174419668c.herokuapp.com

### Login

To create a user, send a POST request to this URL (visit the URL for more details):

https://quizzerapp-2c174419668c.herokuapp.com/auth/users/

The POST request should look like this:

```json
{
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "email": "",
  "first_name": "",
  "last_name": ""
}
```

You can send a POST request to this URL to receive a refresh token and an access token (which is valid for 2 hours):

https://quizzerapp-2c174419668c.herokuapp.com/auth/jwt/create/

The POST request should look like this:

```json
{
  "username": "",
  "password": ""
}
```

Then, add the access token to your headers when using the authorized API endpoints (key: "Authorization", value: "JWT ${access_token}").
